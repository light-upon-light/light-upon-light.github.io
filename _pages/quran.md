## The Book

> Key aspects of the Qur’an which, taken together and in relation to one another, demonstrate its miraculous nature.

### Mode of Revelation

1. Revealed **entirely by oral recitation** to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, a bedouin man in the desert who could **neither read nor write** more than 1400 years ago.
1. Revealed over 23 years, in **partial portions** and **out of chronological order**, often in response to unforeseen events, which would make long-term preplanning impossible.
1. One Shot Wonder: Once revealed and spoken, verses were **fixed permanently** without **retraction** or **alteration**, yet together they form a perfectly coherent whole.
1. The Qur’an itself affirms the **Prophet's ﷺ non-literacy**.
    > “You ˹O Prophet˺ could not read any writing ˹even˺ before this ˹revelation˺, nor could you write at all. Otherwise, the people of falsehood would have been suspicious.” (**Al-‘Ankabut 29:48**)

### Literary Miracle

1. Length of **600+ pages**.
1. Recognized by experts throughout the ages as the **pinnacle of Arabic eloquence**.
1. Neither poetry nor prose, but a **unique literary form** which combines rhythmic beauty and precision of meaning.
1. Maintains the same **peak literary quality across all 23 years** of revelation, unlike any human author whose style evolves over time.
1. The Prophet’s ﷺ personal life, emotions, and grievances **never distort the Qur’an’s message**; it maintains an **objective, divine voice**.
1. Serves as a **perfect reference** for Arabic grammar and contains no linguistic errors.
1. Came in the height of Arabic eloquency and **challenged the Arabs** to produce anything like it.
1. Despite intense hostility, **no** contemporary or later **critic** has succeeded in **producing a work** that the Arabic-speaking world accepts as **equal or superior** or even remotely close.
1. Arabs had to resort to calling Prophet Muhammad ﷺ a **magician or sent by satan** when the miraculousness of the Quran trumped them.
1. Layers and **layers of meaning**. Multiple meanings at different levels for verses.
1. Ring structure: Displays intricate **symmetrical patterns** (chiastic structures) within verses, chapters, and even across chapters—achieved without chronological sequencing or later editing.
    > This in combination with revelation that is: partial, out of order, one shot and with no take backs is miraculous in its own right, let alone in addition to all the other aspects. ([Marvels of the Qur'an \| Dr. Ali Ataie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gJWIGLJhHM))
1. Can be **read in any order** of chapters while retaining coherence, guidance, and thematic unity—unlike typical narratives.
1. Modern **linguistic analysis** of the **Hadith** (Prophet Muhammad’s ﷺ own speech) and the **Qur’an** shows clear, consistent differences in style and structure, indicating **distinct sources**.
    > It would be virtually impossible for a non-literate person to alter his natural mode of expression so completely and exclusively when orally revealing the Qur’an, especially in light of all other characteristics of the text.
1. **Flows perfectly** and is **beautifully melodic**. Even non-Arabic speakers are moved to tears upon hearing its recitation from its profound **effect on the hearts** of people.

### Bold Claims and Challenges

1. Claims it is the **verbatim word of God**. No other book written by a human makes that claim about itself, nonetheless any that is this **widespread and miraculous**.
1. The very **first sentence** after the opening chapter says: “This is the Book! There is no doubt about it—a guide for those mindful ˹of God˺” (**Al-Baqarah 2:2**). Extremely bold claims off the rip.
1. Claims it has **no contradictions**, and that if it were man-made you would find many contradictions in it. And the test of time proves that it does not have any contradictions.
    > People have been trying to find any for 1400+ years and if there really were any, the whole claim from God would fall apart very quickly
1. **Challenges** the whole of **human kind** to produce **something like it**, even 10 chapters, even 1 chapter like it and call upon people to follow them. No one has been able to do so.
    > “Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ ‘If ˹all˺ humans and jinn were to come together to produce the equivalent of this Quran, they could not produce its equal, no matter how they supported each other.’” (**Al-Isrā’ 17:88**)

    > “Or do they say, ‘He has fabricated this ˹Quran˺!’? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ ‘Produce ten fabricated sûrahs like it and seek help from whoever you can—other than Allah—if what you say is true!’ But if your helpers fail you, then know that it has been revealed with the knowledge of Allah, and that there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him! Will you ˹not˺ then submit ˹to Allah˺?” (**Hūd 11:13-14**)

    > “And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a sûrah like it and call your helpers other than Allah, if what you say is true. But if you are unable to do so—and you will never be able to do so—then fear the Fire fuelled with people and stones, which is prepared for the disbelievers.” (**Al-Baqarah 2:23-24**)

### Guidance, Law, and Morality

1. Claims to be the **final divine revelation** to humanity.
    > History confirms no later religion has spread on a fraction of its scale.
1. As the final message, the Qur’an comes from the same **Divine Author**, **affirming** earlier scriptures, **expanding** their guidance, and **restoring** the truth where it had been altered.
1. Main messages of **love, mercy and compassion**.
1. Provides a complete **moral and legal framework** that guided a flourishing civilization.
1. Provides an **ethical system** balancing **justice, mercy, and compassion**.
1. Remains **universally relevant**, addressing 7th-century Arabs and modern readers without cultural obsolescence.

### Knowledge: Historical, Scientific and Linguistic

1. **Scientific knowledge** (much that was unknowable at the time).

    > [Are there scientific miracles in the Qur'an?](https://youtu.be/DoP6Ft-VE70)
1. Very **accurate historical information**, some only confirmed by modern historians.
    > [The Qur'an and the Secrets of Egypt](https://youtu.be/c2ovILc_sKY)
1. Tells stories from the Bible, but **precisely avoids and corrects its historical inaccuracies**.
    > e.g. Title of Pharoah vs King at time of Moses vs Jospeh, Jews few in number at the time of the exodus, etc.
1. Miraculous **mathematical structures**.
    > [Mathematical Miracles in the Qur'an: A Measured Approach](https://youtu.be/QC3sDbVcAbw)
1. **Aptronym**-like references to other languages that Prophet Muhammad ﷺ **didn’t know how to speak**.
    > [The Hebrew word that PROVED that the Quran is from Allah](https://youtu.be/wA4v8MrBHHc)

### Preservation and Memorization

1. The Qur’an has been **perfectly preserved** for over 1,400 years through **mass oral transmission** (and supported by written records).
    > No other text in human history, especially one from such antiquity or claiming divine origin, has been preserved in this way, free from loss, alteration, or dependency on human translation and interpretation.
1. **Easily memorized**. It is common and normal for muslims to memorize it fully. There are **millions of people** today who **memorize** it from **cover to cover** perfectly.
    > The majoriy of which are non native Arabic speakers. In fact, Arabic is not the first language of around 80% of Muslims today.
1. If somehow all the physical evidence of the Quran **suddenly disappeared**, we would be able to **recreate it perfectly** from people’s memory **within a day**.

### Prophecies

1. **Prophesies** its own widespread.
1. **Prophesies** its own **perfect preservation** and that God will protect it until the end of time.
1. **Prophesies** its own **ease of memorization**:
    > “And We have certainly made the Qur’an easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember?” (**Al-Qamar 54:17**)
1. Contains many other fulfilled **future prophecies**:
    > e.g. Defeat of those who try to outdo the Qur’an, Defeat of Meccan opposition, Abu Lahab’s eternal loss, Preservation of the drowned Pharoah’s body, the defeat and victory of byzantium, etc.

### Historical Impact and Transformation

1. Vast majority of **Arabs became Muslims** as a result of it.
1. **Inspired millions** of people throughout history, and **2+ billion muslims today**.
1. Resulted in the **second-most widespread religion** after Christianity.
1. For the first 13 years in Makkah, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his followers were mocked, beaten, starved, stripped of status and wealth, cut off by boycott, exiled, and robbed of safety—yet they **refused to abandon the message**.

## The Messenger of God

1. All of that from the mouth of **one non-literate bedouin man** from the desert more than 1400 years ago.
1. Who is considered to be one of the **most influential figures** in human history.

1. The more you learn about his life, the more you will love him for his **unmatched character, compassion, and mercy**, and the clearer the **evidence** for his prophethood will become.
1. Many many **evidences of his prophethood** from his own **life story** and **actions**. This is a whole area to research on its own, however here are some examples:
1. At the start of his message, Prophet Muhammad's ﷺ people tried to **bribe** him with wealth, status, and power to make him **abandon his call to God**—but he **refused without hesitation**.
1. Even later in life, when he held **authority over Arabia** and could have **claimed immense wealth**, he chose to **live simply and humbly**, **giving away** what he had and leaving this world with almost **no worldly possessions**.
1. Even **respected Christian scholars** acknowledge him as a **true prophet of God**.
