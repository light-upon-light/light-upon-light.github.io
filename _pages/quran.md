Miraculousness of the Quran:
- Orally revealed.
- Revealed partially and out of order.
- Revealed in response to events as they happen. (More proof for it impossible being pre-planned)
- One shot wonder, no takebacks or edits once uttered.
- 600+ pages.
- Most eloquent Arabic text that ever existed. (This is a whole area of research and rich depth on its own)
- Came in the height of Arabic eloquency and challenged the Arabs to produce anything like it.
- Arabs had to resort to calling Prophet Muhammad ﷺ a magician or sent by satan when the miraculousness of the Quran trumped them.
- Vast majority of arabs became Muslims as a result of it.
- Perfect reference for Arabic grammar. Has zero grammatical errors.
- Ring structure within verses and within chapters. And has rings within rings. (This in combination with the partial, out-of-order, one shot, no take-backs revelation is miraculous on its own, let alone in addition to everything else) (https://youtu.be/9gJWIGLJhHM)
- Builds on the Abrahamic religions and comes as the final message, confirming all religions before it and building on them.
- Claims to be the final message to humanity and it was. No other religion that was started after Islam spread a fraction in comparison.
- Tells stories from the bible, but precisely avoids and corrects it’s historical inaccuracies.
- Has laws for flourishing human society. (Evidenced by the flourishing of muslim society after)
- A complete moral system.
- Main messages of love, mercy and compassion.
- Scientific knowledge (a lot of it was unknowable at the time). (https://youtu.be/J_Dllu42eEA and many other videos)
- Astounding mathematical miracles. (https://youtu.be/QC3sDbVcAbw)
- Aptronym-like references to other languages that Prophet Muhammad ﷺ didn’t know how to speak. (https://youtu.be/wA4v8MrBHHc)
- Future prophecies.
- Very accurate historical information. (https://youtu.be/c2ovILc_sKY and many other videos)
- Claims it is the word of God.
- Recent linguistics studies of the text of Hadith (Prophet Muhammad’s ﷺ own words) and the Quran reveal that they undoubtably have different speakers. (Near impossible for him to completely change his way of speaking at will only when revealing the Quran)
- The very first sentence after the opening chapter says: “This is the Book! There is no doubt about it—a guide for those mindful ˹of God˺.” Extremely bold claims off the rip.
- Claims it has no contradictions, and that if it was man-made you would find many contradictions in it. And it indeed does not have any contradictions. (People have been trying to find any for 1400+ years and if there really were any, the whole claim from God would fall apart very quickly)
- Challenges the whole of human kind to produce something like it, even 10 chapters, even 1 chapter like it and call upon people to follow them. No one has been able to do so, even with people trying their hardest:
- “Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ ‘If ˹all˺ humans and jinn were to come together to produce the equivalent of this Quran, they could not produce its equal, no matter how they supported each other.’” (Al-Isrā’ 17:88)
- “Or do they say, ‘He has fabricated this ˹Quran˺!’? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ ‘Produce ten fabricated sûrahs like it and seek help from whoever you can—other than Allah—if what you say is true!’ But if your helpers fail you, then know that it has been revealed with the knowledge of Allah, and that there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him! Will you ˹not˺ then submit ˹to Allah˺?” (Hūd 11:13-14)
- “And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a sûrah like it and call your helpers other than Allah, if what you say is true. But if you are unable to do so—and you will never be able to do so—then fear the Fire fuelled with people and stones, which is prepared for the disbelievers.” (Al-Baqarah 2:23-24)
- Flows naturally and is beautifully melodic. (Listeners are often deeply moved by it just from how it sounds, even if they don’t speak Arabic or understand the meaning)
- Layers and layers of meaning. Multiple meanings and levels of meanings for verses.
- Inspired millions of people throughout history, and 2+ billion people today.
- Resulted in the second-most widespread religion after its own predecessor Christianity.
- Prophesies it’s own widespread.
- Perfectly preserved through mass oral transmission for 1400+ years in its original language, word for word, and even exact same pronunciation. Only text (especially religious with a claim from God) that is like that.
- Prophesies it’s own perfect preservation and that God will make sure it’s preserved.
- Easily memorized. It is common and normal for muslims to memorize it fully. Millions of people today who memorize it from cover to cover perfectly.
- Prophesies it’s own ease of memorization and transmission: “And We have certainly made the Qur’an easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember?” (Al-Qamar 54:17)
- If somehow all the physical Qurans were burned in an instant, we would be able to recreate it perfectly from people’s memory within a day. No other book can make that claim
- Amazing video on the miraculousness of the Quran: https://youtu.be/9gJWIGLJhHM
- All this from the mouth of one unlettered bedouin man from the desert ﷺ.
- Who is considered to be one of the most influential figures in human history.
- And learning about his life will make you fall in love with him and his all-encompassing character, love and mercy. The more you learn about him the more you will love him.
- Many many evidences of his prophethood from his own life story and actions.
- Even respected Christian scholars acknowledge him as a true prophet of God. (https://www.youtube.com/live/ftRsC_2sjg8)
