> This page outlines a number of aspects that demonstrate the **miraculous nature** of the **Qur'an** and the **prophethood** of **Prophet Muhammad** ﷺ. While each point may not constitute a miracle or a decisive proof of prophethood on its own, together they provide compelling evidence for the Qur'an's divine origin and authenticity of the prophet's mission.

## The Book

### Mode of Revelation

1. Revealed **entirely by oral recitation** through Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, a bedouin man in the desert who could **neither read nor write** more than 1400 years ago.
1. Revealed over 23 years, in **partial portions** and **out of order**, often in direct response to unforeseen events (which would make long-term preplanning impossible). And then when put in place they fit together like a majestic  literary puzzle.
1. One Shot Wonder: Once revealed and spoken, verses were **fixed permanently** without **retraction** or **alteration**, yet together they form a perfectly coherent whole.
1. The Qur'an itself affirms the **Prophet's ﷺ non-literacy**.
    > “You ˹O Prophet˺ could not read any writing ˹even˺ before this ˹revelation˺, nor could you write at all. Otherwise, the people of falsehood would have been suspicious.” (**Al-‘Ankabut 29:48**)

### Literary Miracle

1. Length of **600+ pages**.
1. Recognized by experts throughout the ages as the **pinnacle of Arabic eloquence**.

    > [Incredible Word Patterns found in the Quran](https://youtu.be/vady0SQGHCU)

    > [ONE WORD Proving the Quran is Allah's Words \| Arabic101](https://youtu.be/OED98p4bpx0)
1. Neither poetry nor prose, but a **unique literary form** which combines rhythmic beauty and precision of meaning.
1. Maintains the same **peak literary quality across all 23 years** of revelation, unlike any human author whose style evolves over time.
1. Serves as a **perfect reference** for Arabic grammar and contains no linguistic errors.
1. Encompasses **multiple layers** of meaning within its verses, including the apparent, exoteric sense as well as deeper, often multilayered esoteric significances.
1. Ring structure: Displays intricate **symmetrical patterns** (chiastic structures) within verses, chapters, and even across chapters—achieved without chronological sequencing or later editing.
    > This point in combination with revelation that is: partial, out of order, one shot and with no take backs is miraculous in its own right, let alone in addition to all the other aspects.

    > [THE RING COMPOSITION! - Remarkable Structure of the Quran](https://youtu.be/b5Y5gMc_XZo)
1. Can be **read in any order** of chapters while retaining coherence, guidance, and thematic unity—unlike typical narratives.
1. It emerged at the **pinnacle of Arabic** eloquence, **challenging the Arabs** to produce anything comparable.
    > The Qur'an was revealed in an era when the **Arabs** had reached the very **summit of Arabic** language eloquence and rhetoric. **Poetry** was not mere entertainment; it was the **lifeblood of their culture**, the **measure of honor**, and even a **weapon in war**—tribes would settle disputes or ignite battles through verses. In this context, where **pride in language** was unrivaled and **mastery of Arabic** expression was their greatest art, the **Qur'an openly challenged** them to produce anything like it. Despite their unmatched command of Arabic and every worldly motive to discredit the Prophet ﷺ, they were unable to respond, and **their failure** itself became a **perpetual testimony** to the **Qur'an's inimitability**.
1. Despite intense hostility, **no** contemporary or later **critic** has succeeded in **producing a work** that the Arabic-speaking world accepts as **equal or superior** or even remotely close.
1. Arabs had to resort to accusing Prophet Muhammad ﷺ of being a **magician or inspired by satan** when they were trumped by the miraculousness of the Qur'an.
1. The Prophet's ﷺ personal life, emotions, and grievances **never distort the Qur'an's message**; it maintains an **objective, divine voice**.
1. Modern **linguistic analysis** of the **Hadith** (The corpus of Prophet Muhammad's ﷺ own personal speech) and the **Qur'an** shows clear, consistent differences in style and structure, indicating **distinct sources**.
    > It would be virtually impossible for a non-literate person to alter his natural mode of expression so completely and consistently exclusively when orally revealing the Qur'an, especially in light of all other characteristics of the text.

    > [Conquering Doubts & Confidently Defending Islam \| Ali Ataie](https://youtu.be/_HlpfgaDATU) (The whole of this video is great)

1. **Flows perfectly** and is **beautifully melodic**. Even non-Arabic speakers are moved to tears upon hearing its recitation from its profound **effect on the hearts** of people.

### Challenges and Bold Claims

1. Claims it is the **verbatim word of God**. No other book written by a human makes that claim about itself, nonetheless any that is this **widespread and miraculous**.
1. The very **first sentence** after the opening chapter says: “This is the Book! There is no doubt about it—a guide for those mindful ˹of God˺” (**Al-Baqarah 2:2**). Extremely bold claim off the rip.
1. Claims it has **no contradictions**, and that if it were man-made you would find many contradictions in it. And the test of time proves that it does not have any contradictions.
    > People have been trying to find any for 1400+ years and if there really were any, the whole claim from God would fall apart very quickly
1. **Challenges** the whole of **human kind** to produce **something like it**, even 10 chapters, even 1 chapter like it and call upon people to follow them. No one has been able to do so.
    > “Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ ‘If ˹all˺ humans and jinn were to come together to produce the equivalent of this Qur'an, they could not produce its equal, no matter how they supported each other.'” (**Al-Isrā' 17:88**)

    > “Or do they say, ‘He has fabricated this ˹Qur'an˺!'? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ ‘Produce ten fabricated sûrahs like it and seek help from whoever you can—other than Allah—if what you say is true!' But if your helpers fail you, then know that it has been revealed with the knowledge of Allah, and that there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him! Will you ˹not˺ then submit ˹to Allah˺?” (**Hūd 11:13-14**)

    > “And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a sûrah like it and call your helpers other than Allah, if what you say is true. But if you are unable to do so—and you will never be able to do so—then fear the Fire fuelled with people and stones, which is prepared for the disbelievers.” (**Al-Baqarah 2:23-24**)

### Guidance, Law, and Morality

1. Claims to be the **final divine revelation** to humanity.
    > History confirms no later religion has spread on a fraction of its scale.
1. As the final message, the Qur'an comes from the same **Divine Author**, **affirming** earlier scriptures, **expanding** their guidance, and **restoring** the truth where it had been altered.
1. Main messages of **love, mercy and compassion** and alignment with the **Goodness** and **Truth** that is **God**.
1. Provides a complete **moral and legal framework** that guided a **flourishing civilization**, underpinned by an ethical system balancing **justice, mercy, and compassion**.
1. Remains **universally relevant**, addressing 7th-century Arabs and modern readers without cultural obsolescence.

### Knowledge: Historical, Scientific and Linguistic

1. Contains tons of **scientific knowledge**, much of which was unknowable at the time.

    > [Are there scientific miracles in the Qur'an?](https://youtu.be/DoP6Ft-VE70)
1. Very **accurate historical information**, some of which was only confirmed recently by modern historians.
    > [The Qur'an and the Secrets of Egypt](https://youtu.be/c2ovILc_sKY)
1. Tells stories from the Bible, but precisely **avoids** and **corrects** its **historical inaccuracies**.
    > e.g. Title of Pharoah vs King at time of Moses vs Jospeh, Jews few in number at the time of the exodus, etc.

    > [Stories of the Prophets: Bible vs. Qur'an](https://youtu.be/lEc_ilaHim8)

    > [The Qur'an and the Secrets of Egypt](https://youtu.be/c2ovILc_sKY)
1. Unbelievable **mathematical structures** embedded in the text.

    > [The Numerical Miracles in the Quran \| Arabic101](https://youtu.be/11dDOBdQobQ)
1. Subtle **aptronym**-like references to other languages (that Prophet Muhammad ﷺ didn't know how to speak), which wouldn't have been possible without mastery over both Arabic and these other languages.
    > [The Hebrew word that PROVED that the Qur'an is from Allah](https://youtu.be/wA4v8MrBHHc)

### Preservation and Memorization

1. The Qur'an has been **perfectly preserved** for over 1,400 years through **mass oral transmission**, and supported by a plethora of written records over the years that have been carbon dated.
    > No other text in human history, especially one from such antiquity or claiming divine origin, has been preserved in this way, free from loss, alteration, or dependency on human translation and interpretation.

    > [How To Prove The Quran Has Been Preserved Accurately](https://youtu.be/n281Zyywyn4)
1. It is **easily memorized**. It is common and normal for muslims to memorize its 600+ pages fully. There are **millions of people** today who have it **memorized** from **cover to cover** perfectly.
    > The majoriy of which are non-native Arabic speakers. In fact, Arabic is not the first language of around 80% of Muslims today.

    > [How can the Qur'an be a Miracle for NON-ARABIC Speakers? \| Arabic101](https://youtu.be/5fyF-35naDE)
1. If somehow all the physical evidence of the Qur'an **suddenly disappeared**, we would be able to immediatlty **recreate it perfectly** from people's memories.

### Prophecies

1. **Prophesies** its own widespread.
    > "He is the One Who has sent His Messenger with ˹right˺ guidance and the religion of truth, making it prevail over all others. And sufficient is Allah as a Witness." (**Al-Fath (48:28)**)
1. **Prophesies** its own **perfect preservation** and that God will protect it until the end of time.
    > "Indeed, it is We who sent down the message [i.e., the Qur’ān], and indeed, We will be its guardian." (**Al-Hijr (15:9)**)

    > "The Word of your Lord has been perfected in truth and justice. None can change His Words. And He is the All-Hearing, All- Knowing." (**Al-An’am (6:115)**)
1. **Prophesies** its own **ease of memorization**:
    > “And We have certainly made the Qur'an easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember?” (**Al-Qamar 54:17**)
1. Contains many other fulfilled **future prophecies**:
    > e.g. Defeat of those who try to outdo the Qur'an, Defeat of Meccan opposition, Abu Lahab's eternal loss, Preservation of the drowned Pharoah's body, the defeat and victory of byzantium, etc.

### Historical Impact and Transformation

1. Vast majority of **Arabs became Muslims** as a result of it.
1. **Inspired millions** of people throughout history, and **2+ billion muslims today**.
1. Resulted in the currently **second-most widespread religion** after Christianity, its own predecessor. And rapidly growing to be the most widespread religion in the world.
1. For the first 13 years in Makkah, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his followers were mocked, beaten, starved, stripped of status and wealth, cut off by boycott, exiled, and robbed of safety—yet they **refused to abandon the message**.

## The Messenger of God

1. All of that from the mouth of **one non-literate bedouin man** from the desert more than 1400 years ago.
1. Who is considered to be one of the **most influential figures** in human history.

1. The more you learn about his life, the more you will grow to love him for his **unmatched character, compassion, and mercy**, and the clearer the **evidence** for his prophethood will become.
1. There is an unending amount of **evidences of his prophethood** from his **life story** and **actions**. This is a whole area to research on its own, however below are some examples.
1. At the start of his message, Prophet Muhammad's ﷺ people tried to **bribe** him with wealth, status, and power to make him **abandon his call to God**—but he **refused without hesitation**.
1. Even later in life, when he held **authority over Arabia** and could have **claimed immense wealth**, he chose to **live simply and humbly**, **giving away** what he had and leaving this world with almost **no worldly possessions**.
1. Even **respected Christian and Jewish scholars** acknowledge him as a **true prophet of God**.

    > [Reverend Professor Keith Ward on Blogging Theology](https://www.youtube.com/live/ftRsC_2sjg8)
1. He was foretold by Jesus Christ and in Judaism and other previous world religions.

1. The name *Muhammad* means “the one who is repeatedly praised.” During his lifetime, he was widely opposed and rejected, making this meaning far from evident at the time. Yet today his name is among the most honored and frequently invoked in human history, mentioned daily in prayers and blessings by billions worldwide, in a way that aligns strikingly with the meaning of his name and reflects a reality that could not have been reasonably anticipated from the circumstances of his early mission, let alone at the time of his birth when he was being named by his mother.
1. The message preached by Muhammad ﷺ is in direct continuity with that of Moses and Jesus: devotion to one God, moral accountability, and righteous conduct. The Qur’an presents his mission not as a new religion, but as a restoration and reaffirmation of the same monotheistic message taught by earlier prophets, consistent in its core beliefs and ethical demands despite vast differences in time, place, and circumstance.
