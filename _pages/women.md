It’s a warning for men who put their own responsibilities and burdens on women, when they are not their responsibilities. We do not see leading as a privilege, it’s first and foremost a responsibility and a burden and God has decreed that responsibility and burden to be on men. So men who put their own responsibilities on women will not be successful.
- It’s not that they can’t provide for themselves or protect themselves in certain scenarios, but God put that responsibility on men.
- That ayah about hitting, when you read the tafseer and what the scholars say, you’ll find that the maximum that a man can do is the equivalent of poking with his finger. There are very clear verses in the quran about our main beliefs that don’t need exegesis, like the fact that God is one and the core and main beliefs. But then the vast majority need exegesis by the people qualified to do so to be able to get as close to the intended meaning as possible. And even then they’re all human efforts, and not necessarily the true or most accurate or full meaning, bec quran is perfect and even one sentence can have many many meanings, wisdoms and beauties. And that is even said itself in a verse of the Quran, that there are the mohkamat (clear verses) and the motashabebat (the verses that need efforts of clarification by qualified people), and that the people who want to misrepresent the religion will use these motashabehat to serve their own narrative that they want to portray even when it is completely unrelated to what the deen actually preaches.
- Umak thumma umak…
- And just a general concept. Islam’s biggest teaching is akhlaq (character and morals). And the prophet said “I was only sent to perfect noble character”. So the foundational teaching of Islam is to be a good person to yourself and to other people. And to be kind and empathetic and peaceful and merciful and compassionate and generous and humble and just and honest and every single good quality. And also there is a concept in Islamic jurisprudence which is “la darar wa la derar” which roughly translates to no


Islam's Record on Honoring Women: Text, Law, and Prophetic Practice


This isn't a brochure. It's an argument from sources: Qur'an, rigorously authenticated Sunnah, and the juristic method that grew from them. The claim is simple: Islam grounds the dignity of women in revelation, codifies it in enforceable law, and the Prophet ﷺ modeled it in public and private. Where Muslims fall short, they violate the canon rather than represent it.

1) Foundations in Revelation

Equal moral worth and recompense.
The Qur'an repeatedly collapses the idea of male spiritual superiority:

“Whoever does righteousness—male or female—while a believer, We will give them a good life and reward them…” (16:97)

“I will not waste the work of any worker among you, male or female; you are of one another.” (3:195)

“Indeed, the Muslim men and Muslim women… Allah has prepared for them forgiveness and a great reward.” (33:35)

Shared human origin and mutual protection.
“Created you from a single soul” (4:1) isn't poetry; it's ontology. And “The believing men and believing women are allies of one another (awliyāʾ).” (9:71)

Justice and kindness as the marital baseline.
“Live with them in kindness (muʿrūf).” (4:19)
“He placed between you affection and mercy.” (30:21)

Property and agency.
Women hold independent property and earnings (4:7, 4:32), receive a protected bridal gift that is theirs (4:4), and cannot be coerced or “inherited.” (4:19)

Protection from defamation and coercion.
False sexual accusation demands four witnesses (24:4), a standard set to shield women from reputational violence—centuries before modern defamation law caught up.

2) The Prophet's ﷺ Practice

He never abused women.
ʿĀ'ishah reports he never struck a woman or a servant. That's the actual lived Sunnah.

He required consent.
A woman forced into marriage had it annulled when she complained; the Prophet ﷺ made consent a condition. He taught that a previously married woman's explicit permission is required, and the silence of a shy, never-married woman counts only as permission—not compulsion.

He ordered men not to bar women from the mosque.
“Do not prevent the female servants of Allah from the mosques of Allah.” He even set aside a teaching day specifically for women when they asked for dedicated access.

He condemned harshness.
Multiple narrations report women complaining about husbands who hit them; his assessment of those men was negative. His Farewell Sermon: “Treat women well; you took them as a trust from Allah.”

He centered mothers.
“Who is most deserving of my good companionship?” “Your mother,” repeated three times, then “your father.” That hierarchy of care is explicit.

He mentored scholars.
ʿĀ'ishah was a jurist and teacher whose legal opinions shaped the law. The hadith corpus isn't a boys' club; women transmit, critique, and correct within it.

He honored women in crisis and in battle.
Khawla bint Thaʿlabah pled her marital injustice; a Qur'anic chapter (58:1) begins by noting that Allah heard her complaint. At Uhud, Nusaybah bint Kaʿb defended the Prophet ﷺ with her body.

His first supporter and financier was a woman.
Khadījah—older, wealthy, experienced in trade—was his first believer, his counselor, and his exclusive spouse for 25 years.

3) Legal Architecture That Protects Women

Islam didn't just preach “respect”; it legislated it.

A. Marriage: contract, not ownership

Mahr (bridal gift) is a transfer to the bride herself (4:4).

Guardian (walī) protects interests in the contract; he is not an owner. Classical schools even differ: the Ḥanafīs allow an adult woman to contract her own marriage to a suitable match without a walī—evidence that “guardianship” is a safeguard, not a chain.

Consent is mandatory. Forced marriage is voidable.

B. Maintenance and housing
Husbands owe financial support commensurate with means (65:6–7). The Qur'an prohibits harm during separation or residence. These are enforceable claims in court, not pious wishes.

C. Divorce with due process—for both

Ṭalāq has waiting periods, arbitration, and financial duties, curbing impulsive harm.

Khulʿ gives a wife a path to exit by returning the mahr when reconciliation fails. The Prophet ﷺ granted it without shaming the petitioner.

Harm is categorically barred: “No harm and no reciprocating harm” is a legal maxim built on Prophetic teaching, giving judges power to dissolve abusive marriages.

D. Guardianship as responsibility (qiwāmah), not superiority
“Men are qawwāmūn over women” (4:34) grounds duty: provision and protection. It is not a license to dominate. The verse ends by defining the good husband as one who is devout and the good wife as one who safeguards mutual trust. Any reading that greenlights harm collides with 4:19 (“kindness”), with the Prophet's ﷺ conduct, and with the legal maxim banning harm.

E. Inheritance: predictable shares, guaranteed floor
Before Islam, many women inherited nothing. The Qur'an set entitlements (4:7, 4:11–12): in some cases women receive less than male counterparts; in others they receive more or inherit while male relatives receive nothing (e.g., a sole daughter vs. distant agnates). Crucially, a woman's wealth is hers to keep; men bear legal financial obligations (maintenance, mahr). The system pairs duty with share—not rhetorical equality with invisible burdens.

F. Reputation and bodily security
Slander protections (24:4), high evidentiary standards for ḥudūd, and severe penalties for coerced sex collectively deter the social and legal tools abusers use.

G. Education and public participation
Women sought knowledge openly; the Prophet ﷺ facilitated it. Women pledged allegiance directly (60:12), engaged in commerce (Khadījah), debated public policy (reports of a woman correcting the Caliph on dowry policy), tended the wounded, and transmitted statecraft-relevant hadith.

4) The “Misogyny” Charge—A Direct Rebuttal

“Islam sees women as spiritually inferior.”
Text says the opposite (3:195; 16:97; 33:35; 49:13). There is no female original sin, no Eve-blame narrative in the Qur'an.

“Verse 4:34 permits domestic violence.”
The Prophet ﷺ never hit women, condemned men who did, and mandated kindness. Jurists reading 4:34 bound any disciplinary step by strict limits: non-injurious, symbolic at most, prohibited if harm results, and superseded by the Prophet's ﷺ model and the no-harm maxim. Contemporary courts have the authority—using those same legal principles—to criminalize and punish harm. A reading that normalizes abuse is not fiqh; it is a misuse of a contested word against the weight of the canon.

“Testimony of a woman is half a man's.”
The two-female clause appears in one verse (2:282) about complex commercial debt contracts in a world with very gendered commercial exposure; it is not a blanket rule. Across classical law, women's sole testimony is accepted in areas where they're primary witnesses (e.g., childbirth, nursing, early childhood matters). In modern courts, expert competence and evidentiary reliability—not sex—determine weight, which aligns with the Qur'an's purpose in 2:282: preserving accuracy.

“Inheritance rules are sexist.”
They're structured around obligations. Men owe financial maintenance to wives, children, and sometimes extended kin; women do not. Shares track that burden. And the map of shares is not a single ratio—there are many cases of parity or advantage to women.

“Polygyny proves second-class status.”
The Qur'an restricts polygyny to justice conditions (4:3) and then states you will never achieve perfect equality (4:129)—a sober warning. Historically it functioned in contexts of high male mortality, orphan care, and social safety nets. It is not a blanket ideal, and where justice can't be guaranteed, the verse itself pushes toward monogamy (“then [marry] one”).

“Hijab is oppression.”
The Qur'an lays modesty obligations on men first (24:30) and then on women (24:31). The point is dignity, privacy, and social decency. Women in the Prophet's ﷺ time still traded, asked questions publicly, attended prayers, and traveled. Clothing codes exist in every society; Islam's are explicit, reciprocal in principle, and—when applied correctly—should never be a tool of control or erasure.

“Islamic history sidelined women.”
Not in the sources. ʿĀ'ishah's legal output, the recorded female hadith transmitters, jurists like Umm al-Dardā', and women financiers and patrons contradict the caricature. Where cultures later sidelined women, they did so by straying from, not applying, the Prophetic model.

5) Method: Why These Proofs Bind

This isn't cherry-picking. Islamic law is built from:

Clear texts (naṣṣ): the verses and rigorously authenticated hadith above.

The Prophet's ﷺ continuous practice: what he allowed, forbade, modeled.

Legal maxims distilled from the corpus: no harm, harm is removed, certainty isn't overruled by doubt, custom counts where text is silent.

Objectives of the law (maqāṣid): safeguarding faith, life, intellect, lineage, property—and by extension, dignity. Any application that damages those for women contradicts purpose and can be restrained or voided by a judge.

That toolkit is how jurists historically blocked harmful practices and how contemporary Muslim-majority courts can and should criminalize domestic abuse, enforce maintenance, and secure women's access to education, work, and worship.

6) How the Prophet ﷺ Elevated Women Day to Day

He affirmed girls as a path to Paradise for their parents when raised with care and patience.

He returned home and did household work; companions report him mending and serving in his home.

He accepted correction from women. Reports mention a woman publicly challenging the Caliph ʿUmar on capping dowries; he conceded. That posture tracks directly to the Prophet's ﷺ openness.

He gave women independent religious space: their own teaching sessions, their own bayʿah, their own questions—without mediators.

This is not the language of “second-class.”

7) Where Abuse Comes From (and How Islam Deals with It)

Cultural patriarchy sneaking in under religious vocabulary. Remedy: separate ʿurf (custom) from Sharīʿah; accept the former only when it serves the latter.

Ignoring the Prophet's ﷺ practice while absolutizing one contested reading of 4:34. Remedy: anchor exegesis in his conduct and the no-harm maxim.

Courts failing to enforce women's rights already in the law (mahr, maintenance, housing, child support, custody by best-interest). Remedy: apply the law as written; empower judges to dissolve harmful marriages and sanction abusers.

Gatekeeping knowledge. Remedy: women's access to serious religious and secular education is not optional; it is mandated by the same hadiths that oblige seeking knowledge.

8) Practical Checklist for Communities

Teach the actual marriage fiqh: consent, mahr to the bride, kindness as law, not advice.

Establish confidential complaint pathways for women in mosques; include qualified women in governance.

Publicly condemn domestic abuse from the minbar. Pair it with referral networks and legal help.

Enforce maintenance and post-divorce obligations; make non-payment a reputational liability.

Normalize women's scholarship: fund it, publicize it, and invite it to the front of the room.

Keep mosques welcoming, safe, and accessible for women—per the Prophet's ﷺ order.

9) Bottom Line

By text, by Prophetic model, and by legal structure, Islam does not tolerate treating women as second-class. If you encounter a practice that degrades, coerces, or harms, you're looking at a violation of Islam dressed in Islamic words. The remedy is not to dilute the religion but to apply it—in full, with the Prophet's ﷺ character as the measure.
