# Islam and the Misreading of Qur’an 4:34: A Response to the Abuse Claim

One of the most cited accusations against Islam is the claim that it sanctions domestic abuse, based on *Sūrat al-Nisā’* (4:34) where the verb **“waḍribūhunna”** appears. This reading, however, collapses under scrutiny. When the language, context, Prophetic practice, and juristic tradition are examined in full, it becomes evident that the verse does not license harm but outlines a framework for de-escalating marital conflict.

## 1. The elasticity of the word *daraba*
- Arabic words carry layered meanings, and **daraba** is one of the most polysemous verbs in the language. It can mean *to strike*, but also *to travel, to separate, to set forth, to distance*.
- Many early scholars—including al-Ṭabarī—acknowledged multiple possible readings. Several interpreted *waḍribūhunna* as *“separate from them”* or *“part ways.”*
- Even those who read it as a physical act explicitly ruled out harm. They stressed it must be **symbolic, non-injurious, and closer to a gesture than an act of violence.**

## 2. Prophetic example as the living interpretaion of the Qur'an
- The Qur’an itself commands: *“Indeed, in the Messenger of Allah you have an excellent example”* (33:21).
- Authentic reports state:
  > “The Messenger of Allah never struck anything with his hand, neither a woman nor a servant…” (Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim).
- This is decisive. The Prophet ﷺ is the *living exegesis* of the Qur’an. If the verse authorized harm, his conduct would have embodied it. His lifelong abstention from such behavior proves otherwise.

## 3. The verse as a graduated system of conflict resolution
- 4:34 presents a **three-step sequence** for handling serious marital discord:
  1. *Faʿiẓūhunna* → counsel, advise, engage in dialogue.
  2. *Wahjurūhunna fī’l-maḍājiʿ* → withdraw from the marital bed, signaling disapproval without hostility.
  3. *Waḍribūhunna* → understood either as separation or, at most, a symbolic gesture devoid of harm.
- The progression is clearly toward **defusing tension** and **conflict resolution**, not escalating it into injury.

## 4. Juristic restrictions and ethical framing
- Classical jurists who accepted the physical sense of *daraba* set **severe restrictions**:
  - It must be symbolic and devoid of harm.
  - It must not inflict pain, leave marks, or touch the face or any sensitive area.
  - It cannot be habitual.
  - It was often judged *makrūh* (morally repugnant, though technically allowed).
- Abuse (*ḍarar*) or harm is a recognized ground for divorce in Islamic law, and a husband who harms his wife is accountable before God and the courts.

## 5. Islam’s directives specific to women
Beyond its general ethos, Islam provides explicit, repeated instructions regarding the treatment of women, especially wives. These verses and sayings of the Prophet ﷺ are unambiguous:

### Qur’anic directives
- *“And live with them in kindness (bi’l-maʿrūf).”* (4:19)
- *“Do not retain them to harm them, so that you transgress.”* (2:231)
- *“Do not forget graciousness between you.”* (2:237)
- *“They (wives) are a garment for you, and you are a garment for them.”* (2:187) — a metaphor of intimacy, protection, and comfort.
- *“And among His signs is that He created for you from yourselves spouses that you may find tranquility in them, and He placed between you love (mawadda) and mercy (raḥma).”* (30:21)

### Prophetic teachings
- *“The best of you are those who are best to their wives, and I am the best of you to my wives.”* (Tirmidhī)
- *“The most perfect of the believers in faith are those who are the best in character, and the best of you are the best to your women.”* (Tirmidhī, Aḥmad)
- *“Do not beat the female servants of Allah.”* (Abū Dāwūd, Ibn Mājah; later reports show the Prophet ﷺ was angered when some men did so after this instruction)
- *“A believer must not hate a believing woman (his wife). If he dislikes one of her traits, he will be pleased with another.”* (Muslim)

### His lived example
- He ﷺ never struck a woman or servant in his life (Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim).
- He helped with household chores, mended his clothes, milked animals, and served his family (Ṣaḥīḥ Bukhārī).
- His marriages embodied patience, kindness, and compassion, even during conflict.

Taken together, the Qur’an and Sunnah establish a clear ethic: women are to be honored, protected, and treated with consistent kindness. Abuse is *ẓulm* (oppression), and oppression is categorically forbidden.

## 6. Islam’s core ethos: mercy, love, and compassion
Any reading of Qur’an 4:34 must be measured against the Qur’an’s *overarching principles*. The central values of Islam are mercy, compassion, and mutual love:

- **God’s very essence is mercy:** Every chapter of the Qur’an (except one) begins with *“In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate (al-Raḥmān al-Raḥīm).”*
- **Mercy as the Prophet’s mission:**
  *“We have not sent you except as a mercy to the worlds.”* (21:107)
- **Compassion as a divine trait extended to creation:**
  *“My mercy encompasses all things.”* (7:156)
- **Mutual love as the basis of human relationships:**
  *“Indeed, Allah loves those who rely upon Him”* (3:159), *“Allah loves those who do good”* (2:195).

Islam’s *moral grammar* is mercy and love. Any interpretation that legitimizes cruelty, abuse, or oppression cannot stand when measured against these axioms.

## 7. Misuse versus intended meaning
- Abusers citing the verse are misusing it, just as people have twisted laws or scriptures in every tradition to justify wrongdoing.
- Islam provides internal safeguards: a wife can seek judicial relief, stipulate terms in her marriage contract, and dissolve the marriage if subjected to harm.

## 8. Diversity of scholarly interpretation
- **Ibn ʿAshūr** (d. 1973) held that the verse referred to deterrence, not harm, and that in modern contexts it should be understood as separation.
- Scholars like **Muḥammad ʿAbduh** and **Rashīd Riḍā** categorically rejected that the verse permits hitting.
- This diversity underscores that non-violent readings are the base in Islamic scholarship.

## 9. The Prophet’s moral teaching
- The Prophet ﷺ declared: *“The best of you are those who are best to their wives, and I am the best among you to my wives.”* (Tirmidhī).
- Abuse falls under *ẓulm* (oppression), which the Qur’an and Sunnah consistently condemn as among the gravest sins.

## Conclusion
The charge that Islam authorizes domestic abuse by citing Qur’an 4:34 is built on a shallow, selective reading. Linguistically, *daraba* carries multiple meanings. Contextually, the verse describes stages of reconciliation, not violence. Juristically, even the strictest interpretations prohibit harm. The Prophet’s practice and the Qur’an’s broader commands for kindness render abuse categorically forbidden.

**Far from endorsing harm, Islam establishes safeguards to protect women and sets the Prophet ﷺ—who never harmed his wives—as the model of conduct. The verse is about resolving discord with restraint, not legitimizing abuse.**
