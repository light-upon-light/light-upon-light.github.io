### Prophet Muhammad's marriage to our Lady Aisha

- Prophet Muhammad was slandered by his enemies to be many things, but never said anything about this.
- All his wives except her were divorced or widows.
- His first wife was ~15 years older than him and was divorced and he was monogamously married to her until she died.
- Suitability for a person to get married in Islam is not based on a specific age, but on mental, physical and emotional wellbeing in addition to being ready for the responsibilities of married life. And there is no forced marriage in Islam.
- This actually shows the fluidity of Islamic to adapt to different times and cultures, since no single specific rule will apply to every people.
- La darar wa la derar. In islam there is a rule that things are normally permissible would be impermissible if they cause the other party any kind of harm. Whether physical or psychological.
- So if a man marrying a woman at a certain age (even above the age of modern western age of consent) will cause the woman any kind of harm, then it is unlawful to do.
- And I agree with you, in this day and age, any guy or girl at that age would not be ready in any shape or form for marriage, and so they wouldn't be suited for marriage. And it would be harmful for them. And that is why Islamic scholars forbid that.
- The question is though, was that the case back then? We are 1400+ years apart and we can’t even imagine how they were like back then. Men themselves back then used to get married between 12-18 and become actual men.
- So they were biologically and psychologically very different from us. So our level of physical and psychological development at a certain age right now, is much much less than theirs at that same age, and so the “age of consent” and what would cause physical or psychological harm to individuals is also very different.
- Like you don’t even need to look that far, look at our grandparents, their lives were so so so different than ours at each same age. And surely the rules that worked for them and were best for them are different than ours today.
- Age of marriage in the west till nearly 100 years ago was as low as 12 and 10.
- And that’s just two generations ago, how about literally 1400+ years ago in the desert?
- No Islamic critic up till the 1900s has criticized the prophet for his marriage to aisha.
- Also something I wanted to highlight is Islam’s and the prophet’s ﷺ huge emphasis on that men should treat women with care and kindness. The prophet ﷺ in his final speech, said “estawso bel nesa2 khairan” 3 times consecutively to emphasize on it. And the prophet ﷺ said “khayrokom khayrokom le ahleh, wa ana khayrokom le ahly”, where "ahly" here means their wife.


This is a common and often misrepresented topic used to malign the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ without understanding the historical, cultural, and moral context of the time. It is essential to approach this issue with intellectual honesty, historical accuracy, and an understanding of ethics rooted in time, place, and revelation.

1. Historical Context Matters:

The marriage of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ to Aisha (RA) took place over 1,400 years ago in 7th-century Arabia. At that time, there was no fixed concept of childhood or legal “age of consent” as exists in modern Western societies. Throughout history—and across cultures including Christian Europe, Asia, and Africa—young marriages were common and not considered immoral. The age of maturity was determined by signs of physical and mental development, not by arbitrary numbers.

2. Maturity and Readiness, Not Mere Age:

Islam does not define marriageability by age alone. The Qur’an (Surah An-Nisa 4:6) outlines that marriage is contingent upon physical and mental maturity and a readiness for the responsibilities of married life. There is no room in Islam for forced marriage or exploitation. Aisha (RA) was engaged with full family consent, and later narrated that she was happy and had love for the Prophet ﷺ.

3. No Objection for 1,300+ Years:

It is important to note that for over 1,300 years, no Christian, Jewish, or secular scholar criticised the Prophet ﷺ for this marriage. Orientalist critics of the 18th and 19th centuries who studied Islam in detail never considered it controversial. The accusations only arose in the modern era, where contemporary standards are being projected anachronistically onto a completely different time.

4. Western Double Standards:

Many modern critics come from societies where, until recently, the age of consent was similarly low. For example, in 1880s Britain, it was 12. In some U.S. states, it was as low as 10, and even today, marriage laws allow exceptions with parental or judicial consent. Are we to retrospectively label these societies as immoral? Or does context matter only when convenient?

5. The Character of the Prophet ﷺ:

Let us not forget that the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was known even by his enemies as Al-Ameen (The Trustworthy) and led a life of unmatched moral integrity. His marriage to Aisha (RA) was not predatory but part of the customs and norms of his time, and their relationship was one of mutual respect, deep affection, and spiritual growth. She went on to become one of the greatest scholars of Islam.

Conclusion:

To judge a 7th-century marriage by 21st-century standards is intellectually dishonest and morally inconsistent. Islam sets criteria of maturity, consent, and righteousness—not arbitrary numbers. Those who use this issue to attack Islam reveal a lack of understanding of both history and Islamic values. If one wishes to sincerely understand the life of the Prophet ﷺ, they should look beyond soundbites and seek knowledge with humility.
